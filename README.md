# Deku's Notebook 
-A project using the My Hero Academia API. 

# Inspiration/Where did this idea come from? 
I love creating projects that show off who I am and what I love. I wanted to take a break from working on Data Structures and Algorithms since it was starting to burn me out. I really enjoy anime, and a search led me to finding out that there was an API for the ever popular anime: "My Hero Academia". Remembering the protagonist Deku from the anime and his notebook of the stats of the various heroes and stuff, I decided to call this "Deku's Notebook"
